## Making Cat or Capital: A Lighthearted Experiment

Recently, I embarked on a playful journey to create Cat or Capital, a whimsical web game developed using Windsurf AI, HTML, and JavaScript. This wasn't a serious project but rather a fun experiment to explore the capabilities of AI-assisted coding.

### The Spark of an Idea

The concept was simple: blend the themes of cats and capitalism into a quirky game. With no grand plans or expectations, I set out to see what could be achieved by leveraging AI tools in a casual setting.

### Development with Windsurf AI

Utilizing Windsurf AI, I was able to generate the foundational code swiftly. By providing natural language prompts, the AI assisted in crafting the game's structure, allowing me to focus on the creative aspects.

### Embracing the Process

The development process was more about exploration than perfection. I embraced the quirks and imperfections that came with AI-generated code, finding joy in the unexpected outcomes.

### Final Thoughts

Cat or Capital stands as a testament to the fun and spontaneity that AI tools can bring to coding. It's a reminder that not all projects need to be serious endeavors; sometimes, the best creations come from simply playing around.
