# Personal Webpage Update: A Complete Redesign

Hey everyone,

I've been hard at work completely redesigning my personal webpage, and I'm excited to share what's new! This project has taken longer than expected (doesn't it always?), but I'm really happy with how it's coming together.

## Here's what I've been up to:

### A Fresh Look
The site now has a cleaner, more modern design that feels way more "me." I wanted something that looks good and works well across devices. After all, first impressions matter—even online!

### More Music
Music is such a big part of my life, so I made it a priority to showcase more of it. You'll now find a better display of the tracks I've written or collaborated on. I'm always adding new ones, so keep an ear out!

### Reading List Upgraded
I've updated the reading list section with new cover images to make it visually engaging. (Okay, not all the books have covers yet because some of them just aren't available. Frustrating, right?) But the list is growing, and I hope it inspires you to pick up something new.

## What's Next?
Honestly, this has been a bigger project than I anticipated, but it's rewarding to see the progress. I still have a few tweaks to make here and there, but I'm excited to hear what you think.

Take a look, explore, and let me know what you think! If there's anything you'd love to see on the site, drop me a line—I'd love to hear your suggestions.

Until next time,
