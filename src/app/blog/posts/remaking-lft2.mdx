# Remaking a Classic: LFT2

Today, I brought a piece of the past into the future. It all started when I posted a song called Voice on Facebook. Out of the blue, my high school friend and old bandmate Tony—our drummer back in the day—commented and reminded me about a song we wrote in the early 2000s called LFT (Live for Today). It was one of our favorites, full of that raw, youthful energy we loved to play with.

Hearing that sparked something in me. I thought about just remaking LFT as it was, but honestly, it didn't feel right—it wouldn't capture the same vibe or who I am now. So, I decided to take it in a whole new direction. That's when I turned to Suno.ai and this wild tool called ChatGPT. I asked ChatGPT for some fresh lyrics, keeping the essence of the original but with a modern twist.

From there, I jumped back into Suno.ai, crafting a punk rock vibe with that driving beat and whispery edge we used to love. To keep it close to the spirit of the original, I sang the lyrics into Suno myself, layering in as much of that raw, nostalgic energy as I could.

Now, I'm proud to say LFT2 is here for you to listen to on this very website. It's not just a song—it's a bridge between then and now, a nod to who we were and a celebration of where we're headed.
