## Introduction

"Cat or Capital" is a playful web game that challenges players to decide whether a name belongs to a cat or a world capital. Inspired by the success of "Girls Name or Drug," I wanted to create another quick, fun, and slightly educational experience.

## The Idea

The idea came from a conversation about how some cat names sound just as exotic as capital cities. After jotting down a list of ambiguous names, the concept for the game was born.

## Implementation

The game is built as a standalone HTML/JS app and embedded directly into my site. The main challenge was curating a balanced list of names and making the UI as intuitive as possible. I used the same approach as with my previous game, ensuring the experience feels consistent.

## Play the Game!

You can play Cat or Capital right here on my site, or [open it in a new tab](/games/cat-or-capital/cat-or-capital.html).
