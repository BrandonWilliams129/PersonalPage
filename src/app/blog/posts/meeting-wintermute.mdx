# Picking Up Wintermute: From Trailhawk to Spaceship

The day I met Wintermute. It was a quick and smooth transaction—almost too smooth for something so life-changing. I traded in my trusty 2014 Jeep Trailhawk, said goodbye to years of rugged adventures, and in return, I drove away in something straight out of a sci-fi novel.

Wintermute wasn't just a car; it was a spaceship on wheels, sleek, futuristic, and alive with potential. As I sat behind the wheel for the first time, it felt like I'd stepped into the future.

After a few hours on the road, the cameras finished calibrating, and that's when the real magic happened. For the first time, Wintermute drove itself. I won't lie—my heart raced. Watching the steering wheel move on its own, I felt like I was in a ghost story, only the ghost was an AI, and I was the spectator. It was surreal, like the car was saying, "Don't worry, I've got this."

From that moment on, Wintermute became more than just a vehicle. It was a partner, a glimpse into what's possible when technology pushes boundaries. Trading the Trailhawk for this was more than an upgrade—it was a leap into a whole new way of seeing the road, and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way.
